# Number_Plate_Recognition

This project focuses on using Image Processing techniques and Deep Learning to detect number plate and recognize its characters.

## Tools and Libraries:

* Python 3.8.1
* OpenCV 4.2.0
* Tensorflow 2.2.0
* Keras 2.4.3
* Matplotlib 3.2.2
* Numpy 1.19.0
* Pytesseract 0.3.4

## Usage:
**This project is implemented in two different ways-**
1. Using only Image Processing techniques to detect number plate and using PyTesseract for character recognition.

```
script1.py    
```
2. Using Haar cascade classifier to detect number plate and using Deep learning model for character recognition.

```
script2.py   
```

* **NOTE-** Classifier and deep learning model used were already pre-trained for their specific purpose.
